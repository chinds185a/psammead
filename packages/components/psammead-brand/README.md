## Description

The `Brand` component provides the BBC News logo (as SVG), nested inside a styled span, link and div. The link is currently hardcoded to "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news". `Brand` takes a `brandName` as a prop. This prop is passed to a [VisuallyHiddenText](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/VisuallyHiddenText) component, nested inside Brand. Note that this does not currently affect the branding itself, which always renders as `BBC NEWS`.

## Installation

`npm install @bbc/psammead-brand`

## Props

| Argument  | Type | Required | Default | Example |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| No props. |      |          |         |         |

## Usage

The typical use-case of this component is at the top of pages in a [`header` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header). When this is done it is recommend that the component is wrapped in a [`banner` role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Banner_role). However, a `header` with a `banner` role should only appear once on a page.

```jsx
import Brand from '@bbc/psammead-brand';

const Header = brandName => (
  <header role="banner">
    <Brand brandName={brandName} />
  </header>
);
```

### When to use this component

The `Brand` component is designed to be used where a BBC logo is required as SVG. `Brand` is used in the [BrandContainer](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/tree/latest/src/app/containers/Brand), which consumes a service context it passes to the `Brand`.

### Accessibility notes

- Visually hidden text is provided (e.g. for screen reader users)
- `Brand` is keyboard-accessible and provides hover and focus styles
- The brand SVG has support for users with css disabled or high contrast mode enabled.
